\description{
This function evaluates a user-provided R expression in a clean
environment and compares the resulting value to an expected
output.  It returns `TRUE` when the evaluated result matches
the expected value (within a small numeric tolerance) and
`FALSE` otherwise.  Errors generated during evaluation are
treated as incorrect answers.
}

check_answer("mean(c(1,2,3))", 3)  # FALSE
}
